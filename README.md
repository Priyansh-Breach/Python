Welcome to the Python Projects Repository! This repository contains two Python projects: "Instagram Reach Analysis" and "Stock Market Analysis." Each project is presented as a Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) file.

## Project 1: Instagram Reach Analysis

### Overview
The "Instagram Reach Analysis" project is designed to analyze the reach and engagement of your Instagram posts. It utilizes the Instagram Graph API to fetch data about your posts and generate insightful visualizations to understand how your content performs.

### Features

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Obtain access tokens and API keys from the Facebook Developer portal.
3. Update the `config.py` file with your access tokens.
4. Run the "Instagram_Reach_Analysis.ipynb" notebook to start the analysis.

## Project 2: Stock Market Analysis

### Overview
The "Stock Market Analysis" project focuses on analyzing historical stock market data and making data-driven investment decisions. It utilizes popular libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy to process and visualize the data.
